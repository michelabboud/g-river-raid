## Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. Fuel Management

**Critical System:** Your jet constantly consumes fuel. Running out of fuel = instant crash!

#### Fuel Consumption
- **Normal flight**: Steady fuel consumption
- **Accelerating**: Increased fuel consumption
- **Base rate**: ~1% per few seconds (varies by difficulty)

#### Refueling Options

**Fuel Canisters** (Pink/Red icons)
- Float in the river
- Fly over them to collect
- Restores fuel gradually (typically +20-30%)
- Most common refueling method

**Fuel Depots** (Blue structures)
- Fixed locations on riverbanks
- Instantly refill tank to 100%
- Less common than canisters
- Strategic collection points

**Fuel Management Tips:**
- Never let fuel drop below 20%
- Plan your route to hit fuel canisters
- Prioritize fuel over enemy kills when low
- Boss defeats also restore some fuel

---

### 2. Combat System

#### Shooting Mechanics
- **Default Weapon**: Single forward-firing bullet
- **Fire Rate**: Moderate (can be upgraded)
- **Bullet Speed**: Fast (can be upgraded)
- **Upgrades**: Spread shot, rapid fire, speed boost

#### Enemy Destruction
- Shoot enemies before they reach you
- Some enemies require multiple hits
- Destroyed enemies may drop power-ups or coins
- Collision with enemies = lose a life

#### Targeting Priority
1. **Immediate threats** (enemies coming at you)
2. **High-value targets** (jets, helicopters)
3. **Fuel canisters** (when fuel is low)
4. **Collectibles** (when safe to do so)

---

### 3. Navigation

#### River Terrain
- **River banks**: Instant death on collision
- **Width**: Varies throughout the course
- **Obstacles**: Islands, bridges, structures
- **Generation**: Procedurally generated for endless play

#### Movement Strategy
- **Stay centered** when possible for maximum maneuverability
- **Plan ahead** - watch for narrow passages
- **Smooth movements** - avoid jerky controls
- **Speed control** - faster = harder to maneuver
